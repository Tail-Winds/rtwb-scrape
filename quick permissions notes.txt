Make sure you're signed into the correct account! I ran into many hours of frustration trying to get permissions to work, only to find out that I had made the key in my *personal* account rather than my *institutional* account.

Select or create a new project

IAM & Admin > Service Accounts

Create Service Account

Add name, description, and edit permissions if desired

dot/dot/dot on the right > manage keys

Add key > create new key > json > create



*** MAY NEED TO TURN ON API, NOT SURE ***

Menu > APIs and Services

Search for "sheets"

Click "Google Sheets API"

Click "Enable"

*******


You've basically just created a fake Google robot person. You need to give the fake Google robot person access to the document (like you would a real person) using the fake Google robot email that is listed within the Service Accounts section.


Go into your GitHub repo. Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secrets

Copy/paste the JSON text in the file that was downloaded and paste it into the "Secret*" section. Give it a name. Click "Add secret".
